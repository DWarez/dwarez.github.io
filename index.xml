&lt;p>Today&amp;rsquo;s article steps back from our usual technical deep-dives to examine the strategic importance of ML optimization. While we&amp;rsquo;ll touch on engineering concepts, we&amp;rsquo;ll focus more on their business impact.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Machine Learning Surgeon's Guide to Quantization: Precision Cuts for Smarter Models</title><link>https://dwarez.github.io/posts/quantization/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dwarez.github.io/posts/quantization/</guid><description>&lt;p>As humans, we perceive space and time as a seamless, continuous flow. This perception leads us to believe that continuity—and perhaps even infinity—is a fundamental aspect of nature. However, some scientific theories challenge this assumption. For example, &lt;strong>string theory&lt;/strong> posits that the universe&amp;rsquo;s fundamental components are tiny, vibrating strings, where different vibrations define different particles. Similarly, &lt;strong>loop quantum gravity&lt;/strong> suggests that space itself is made up of discrete &amp;ldquo;grains,&amp;rdquo; implying that reality might not be as continuous as it appears.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Operating Room Setup</title><link>https://dwarez.github.io/posts/dev-setup/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dwarez.github.io/posts/dev-setup/</guid><description>&lt;p>Undoubtedly, one of the most critical aspects of machine learning is understanding the theory—without grasping how machines learn, you&amp;rsquo;ll never excel as an ML Surgeon! But being a surgeon isn&amp;rsquo;t just about theory; it’s about getting your hands dirty—writing code, setting up infrastructures, and operating on the intricacies of data. That’s why having a tailored, efficient, and &lt;strong>functional&lt;/strong> development setup is essential to stay productive and ensure everything gets done right.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dissecting torch.compile: Surgical Precision in PyTorch Optimization</title><link>https://dwarez.github.io/posts/torch-compile/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dwarez.github.io/posts/torch-compile/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

How is life treating you? I hope you&amp;rsquo;ve spent your vacation relaxing, far, far away from the tools of our trade. After all, a good surgeon needs to rest after a long year of work and learning, right? With that in mind, I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen a simple yet useful topic to discuss today, so you can stay relaxed and not worry about the tremendous complexity of our field—at least for now.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Performing Kernel Surgery: Profiling CUDA Kernels with NVIDIA Nsight Compute</title><link>https://dwarez.github.io/posts/profiling-introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dwarez.github.io/posts/profiling-introduction/</guid><description>&lt;p>Being a Machine Learning Surgeon is not an easy life. We not only have to deal with intricate machine learning systems but also navigate the additional complexities surrounding them. To be a proficient ML Surgeon, we must develop a diverse skill set. First and foremost, we need a deep understanding of machine learning and deep learning. Additionally, we must be adept at writing software, building infrastructures to host and integrate models, managing large volumes of data, and much more. This requires familiarity with numerous tools.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Machine Learning Surgeon’s Toolkit: Advanced Matrix Multiplication in CUDA</title><link>https://dwarez.github.io/posts/matrix-multiplication/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dwarez.github.io/posts/matrix-multiplication/</guid><description>&lt;p>During the first year of my Master&amp;rsquo;s Degree in Computer Science, I had to complete a project for a Machine Learning course.

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Large Language Model&lt;/strong>. How many times did you read that term? Nowadays, the popularity of Artificial Intelligence is to be attributed to the exceptional results obtained, in the past few years, by applications that leverage large models. Surely, you know the most popular one, ChatGPT, made by OpenAI.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://dwarez.github.io/posts/intro_triton/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dwarez.github.io/posts/intro_triton/</guid><description>&lt;h1 class="relative group">Machine Learning Surgery&amp;rsquo;s New Instrument: Triton
