      <description>Undoubtedly, one of the most critical aspects of machine learning is understanding the theory—without grasping how machines learn, you&amp;rsquo;ll never excel as an ML Surgeon! But being a surgeon isn&amp;rsquo;t just about theory; it’s about getting your hands dirty—writing code, setting up infrastructures, and operating on the intricacies of data.</description>

      <description>Hello, fellow surgeons! How is life treating you? I hope you&amp;rsquo;ve spent your vacation relaxing, far, far away from the tools of our trade. After all, a good surgeon needs to rest after a long year of work and learning, right?</description>

      <description>During the first year of my Master&amp;rsquo;s Degree in Computer Science, I had to complete a project for a Machine Learning course. It involved implementing a small feed-forward neural network framework from scratch, using only numerical libraries and coding elements such as loss functions, backpropagation, and the feed-forward step.</description>

      <description>In case you didn&amp;rsquo;t already know, CUDA is a parallel computing platform and API, developed by NVIDIA, that enables programmers to exploit certain types of GPUs. Not too long ago (around until 2007), GPUs were solely utilized for graphics rendering, and programmers had to depend on very specific graphics APIs to utilize them for solving general problems.</description>
