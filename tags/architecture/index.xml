It involved implementing a small feed-forward neural network framework from scratch, using only numerical libraries and coding elements such as loss functions, backpropagation, and the feed-forward step.</description></item><item><title>Cerebral Cortex and Hippocampus: Understanding the Computational and Memory Design of GPUs</title><link>https://dwarez.github.io/posts/cpu-gpu-architecture/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dwarez.github.io/posts/cpu-gpu-architecture/</guid><description>Would you operate on a human body without knowing its organs? Similarly, how can you effectively write a GPU kernel without understanding the underlying hardware? This is why it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to understand how GPUs function.</description></item></channel></rss>
