Similarly, how can you effectively write a GPU kernel without understanding the underlying hardware? This is why it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to understand how GPUs function. Knowing the philosophy behind their architectural design, the problems they aim to solve, and the reasons for their specific construction is essential for leveraging their full potential.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
